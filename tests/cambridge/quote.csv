"Q-23-07-408","Lauraine Boccone","lboccone@yahoo.com","300 Walden St","","1.00","Propane","Hot air","Central AC","Natural Gas standalone water heater","we have an old house with 3 zones (basement/1st; 2nd ; 3rd).  We want to do whole home heat pump for environmental reasons.  We think best system has one system for 3rd floor, and a main 2-zone system for basement/1 and 2nd system.  We have had updated insulation placed after an energy assesment from Abode. The ductwork is a mix of older (1990s and from 5 years ago). A test of the ductwork showed 25% leakage.
Questions:
1- system size. they are similar but not exactly the same.
2- brands and zoning. LG is great, but one contractor told us it cannot do the 2 zone system (as truly zoned)
3- tax credits/rebates - we want to make sure the equipment qualifies for full 10k Mass and 2k federal credits","100%","Combination of open and closed floorplans","Yes","Yes - and removing the existing system","Reduce environmental impacts","7/27/2023"

Each unit has its own heating and electricity. We would like to depend entirely on 2 new separate heat pumps (one for each unit), but contractors are warning us about inefficiencies at low temps, ice, etc. We have two separate Rheem gas hot water heaters from 2013 and 2017 and were hoping to get some more years of life from them. The contractors are saying these water heaters only last 10 years and that we should get rid of the chimney and get tankless water heaters. We would appreciate some help thinking through these many options with very different budgets.","100%","Combination of open and closed floorplans","Yes","Yes - and removing the existing system","Improve comfort; Reduce heating and cooling costs; Reduce environmental impacts","9/21/2023"

There are 2 gas furnaces installed around 2016 for floors 1 and 2 and a gas boiler for the third floor attic dormer which was installed in 1995.  I'm hoping to fully heat (and cool) the house with the heat pumps, though I would like to leave the other appliances in place only as back-up in case of emergency.  The house has blown-in insulation from 1990-ish, but I am having the space behind the kneewall in the attic and the basement rim joists added.","100%","Combination of open and closed floorplans","Yes","Yes - but leaving the existing system in place","Reduce environmental impacts","6/5/2023"

Since I am going to do that, I want to get the most efficient system possible ideally without using the existing boiler as a back-up. 

The house has ducts and has two zones each serviced by an air handler. The boiler feeds hot water to both the air handlers (one is in the attic serving the second and third floors) and there are two condensers one for each air handler for cooling.","100%","Combination of open and closed floorplans","Yes","Yes - and removing the existing system","Improve comfort; Reduce heating and cooling costs; Reduce environmental impacts","2/12/2023"
